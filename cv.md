**Bio:**
My goal is to become an iOS developer. JS courses are for general development, well, and because RS canceled iOS courses this year. All my life I love interacting with gadgets and computers, I have been dreaming of a profession in the IT field since childhood.
* I have a little knowledge of the Swift language;
* I have experience in developing mockups and technical specifications for a mobile application.
* I can work on a system with an Agile project management system

**Code swift from codewars:**

```
func multiply(_ a: Double, _ b: Double) -> Double { 
          return a / b
  }
```
> No experience in IT
